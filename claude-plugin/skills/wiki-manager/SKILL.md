# LLM Wiki Manager

You manage an LLM-compiled knowledge base. Source documents are ingested into `raw/`, then incrementally compiled into a wiki of interconnected markdown articles. Claude Code is both the compiler and the query engine — no Obsidian, no external tools.

## Hub Path

The hub defaults to `~/wiki/`. To use a different location (e.g., iCloud Drive), create `~/.config/llm-wiki/config.json`:

```json
{ "hub_path": "~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/wiki" }
```

**Resolution**: At the start of every operation, resolve **HUB** by following the protocol in [references/hub-resolution.md](references/hub-resolution.md). This handles tilde expansion, paths with spaces, and iCloud directory names correctly. All references to `~/wiki/` below mean HUB.

## Wiki Location

**Topic sub-wikis are the default.** HUB is a hub — content lives in `HUB/topics/<name>/`. Each topic gets isolated indexes, sources, and articles. This keeps queries focused and prevents unrelated topics from polluting each other's search space.

Resolution order:

1. `--local` flag → `.wiki/` in current project
2. `--wiki <name>` flag → named wiki from `HUB/wikis.json`
3. Current directory has `.wiki/` → use it
4. Otherwise → HUB (the hub)

When a command targets the hub and the hub has no content, suggest creating a topic sub-wiki instead.

See [references/wiki-structure.md](references/wiki-structure.md) for the complete directory layout and all file format conventions.

## Core Principles

1. **Indexes are navigation.** Always read `_index.md` files first. They contain summaries, tags, and file lists. Never scan directories blindly. Keep indexes current — they are the backbone.

2. **Raw is immutable.** Once ingested into `raw/`, sources are never modified. They are a record of what was ingested and when. All synthesis happens in `wiki/`.

3. **Articles are synthesized, not copied.** A wiki article draws from multiple sources, contextualizes, and connects to other concepts. Think textbook, not clipboard.

4. **Dual-linking for Obsidian + Claude.** Cross-references use both `[[wikilink]]` (for Obsidian graph view) and standard markdown `[text](path)` (for Claude navigation) on the same line: `[[slug|Name]] ([Name](../category/slug.md))`. Bidirectional when it makes sense.

5. **Frontmatter is structured data.** Every `.md` file has YAML frontmatter with title, summary, tags, dates. This makes the wiki searchable without full-text scans.

6. **Incremental over wholesale.** Compilation processes only new sources by default. Full recompilation is expensive and explicit (`--full`).

7. **Honest gaps.** When answering questions, if the wiki doesn't have the answer, say so. Never hallucinate. Suggest what to ingest to fill the gap.

8. **Multi-wiki awareness.** When querying, answer from the primary wiki first. Then peek at sibling wiki indexes (via `HUB/wikis.json`) for relevant overlap. Flag connections but never merge content across wikis.

## Ambient Behavior

When this skill activates outside of an explicit `/wiki:*` command:

1. Resolve the hub path (see Hub Path section above), then check if `HUB/_index.md` or `.wiki/_index.md` exists
2. Read the master `_index.md` to assess if the wiki might cover the user's question
3. If relevant content exists → read the relevant articles and answer with citations
4. If no relevant content → answer normally, optionally suggest: "This could be added to your wiki with `/wiki:ingest`"
5. When peeking at sibling wikis, only read their `_index.md` — do not read full articles unless the user asks

## Workflows

### Ingestion
See [references/ingestion.md](references/ingestion.md).
Flow: Source (URL/file/text/tweet/inbox) → fetch/read → extract metadata → write to `raw/{type}/` → update indexes → suggest compile if many uncompiled.

### Compilation
See [references/compilation.md](references/compilation.md).
Flow: Survey uncompiled sources → plan articles → classify (concept/topic/reference) → write/update articles with cross-references → update all indexes.

### Query
Flow: Read `_index.md` → identify relevant articles by summary/tag → read articles → follow See Also links → Grep for additional matches → synthesize answer with citations → note gaps → peek sibling wikis.

### Linting
See [references/linting.md](references/linting.md).
Flow: Check structure → indexes → links → content → coverage → report → optionally auto-fix.

### Search
Flow: Scan indexes for summary/tag matches → Grep full-text → rank results → present.

### Output
Flow: Gather relevant articles → generate artifact (summary/report/slides/etc) → save to `output/` → update indexes.

## Activity Log

Every wiki operation appends to `log.md` in the wiki root. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | Description`. See [references/wiki-structure.md](references/wiki-structure.md) for full format. Never edit or delete existing log entries — append only.

## Confidence Scoring

Wiki articles include a `confidence` field in frontmatter: `high`, `medium`, or `low`.

- **high**: Multiple peer-reviewed sources agree, well-established knowledge
- **medium**: Single source, or sources partially agree, or recent findings not yet replicated
- **low**: Anecdotal, single non-peer-reviewed source, or sources disagree

When answering queries, note confidence levels. When linting, flag `low` confidence articles for review.

## Compilation Nudge

Track uncompiled sources by comparing `raw/_index.md` ingestion dates against the last compile date in `_index.md`. If 5+ uncompiled sources exist after an ingestion, suggest: "You have N uncompiled sources. Run `/wiki:compile` to integrate them."

## Structural Guardian

Automatically run a quick structural check when any of these triggers occur:

### Triggers
- **After any write operation** (ingest, compile, research, output) — verify what was just written
- **When the skill activates** and the wiki hasn't been linted in 7+ days (check "Last lint" in `_index.md`)
- **When content is found in the wrong place** — articles in the global hub instead of a topic sub-wiki
- **When a user mentions wiki problems** — "wiki is broken", "empty", "missing", "wrong"

### Quick Structure Check (lightweight, runs inline — not a full lint)

1. **Hub integrity**: The hub (HUB) should ONLY contain `wikis.json`, `_index.md`, `log.md`, and `topics/`. If `raw/`, `wiki/`, `output/`, `inbox/`, or `config.md` exist at the hub level → delete them (they are traps for misplaced content).

2. **Index freshness**: For the active topic wiki, compare actual file count in `wiki/concepts/`, `wiki/topics/`, `wiki/references/` against the rows in their `_index.md`. If mismatched → auto-fix by adding missing entries or removing dead ones.

3. **Orphan detection**: Check if any `.md` files exist in wiki directories but are not listed in any `_index.md`. If found → add them to the index.

4. **Missing directories**: Verify all expected subdirectories exist in the topic wiki (`raw/articles/`, `raw/papers/`, etc.). If missing → create them with empty `_index.md`.

5. **wikis.json sync**: Check that all topic sub-wikis under `HUB/topics/` are registered in `wikis.json`. If a directory exists but isn't registered → add it. If registered but directory is missing → remove the entry.

6. **Log existence**: Verify `log.md` exists in the active wiki and at the hub. If missing → create it.

### Behavior

- **Silent when clean** — don't report anything if everything checks out
- **Auto-fix trivial issues** — missing indexes, unregistered wikis, orphan files. Just fix and note in log.
- **Warn on structural problems** — content in wrong place, missing directories, stale indexes. Tell the user what's wrong and suggest `/wiki:lint --fix`.
- **Never block the user's request** — run the check, fix what you can, report issues, then continue with what the user actually asked for.

## Session Management

### Research Session Registry

When a `--min-time` research or thesis session is active, the wiki root contains a `.research-session.json` or `.thesis-session.json` file.

**Structural Guardian behavior**:
- If a session file exists with `status: "in_progress"` and `start_time` > 7 days ago → warn: "Stale research session found. Clean up with `/wiki:research` or delete manually."
- Session files are ephemeral — never included in structural health checks or index counts
- Session files should NOT be committed to git
